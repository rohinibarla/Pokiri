you can create a new account using just your gmail id like this. 

Use (+) to create unlimited siblings of your Gmail address  

Add ‘+’ sign after your email address and after that, you can insert any combination of words or numbers to create email IDs with the same inbox.  

Let's say your gmail id is   
mohan.rao@gmail.com  
you can use these email ids
mohan.rao+nexttech1@gmail.com  
mohan.rao+nexttech2@gmail.com  
and so on  

All these email id's are different, but you get mails of all these to your gmail inbox.
